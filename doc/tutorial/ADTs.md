# Algebraic Data Types #

Virgil III supports algebraic data types (ADTs), allowing us to build complex immutable data structures that can be manipulated and matched on.

```
type Tree {
    case Empty;
    case Leaf(value: int);
    case Node(left: Tree, right: Tree);
}
var leaf1 = Tree.Leaf(13);
var leaf2 = Tree.Leaf(14);
var node = Tree.Node(leaf1, leaf2);
var empty = Tree.Empty;
```

In Virgil, an ADT type declaration specifies a number of cases, each of which may have *parameters*.
ADT values are constructed by calling the case constructors as if they were functions.
Cases without parameters don't require any arguments and are effectively constants.

## ADTs with methods ##

Virgil allows ADTs to have method definitions as well.
We can define methods directly *in* the declaration and add specific versions of the method for certain cases.
Calling a method on a value uses the familiar `.method()` syntax.

```
type Tree {
    case Empty            { def height() -> int { return 0; } }
    case Leaf(value: int) { def height() -> int { return 1; } }
    case Node(left: Tree, right: Tree) {
    	 def height() -> int {
	     var l = left.height(), r = right.height();
	     return 1 + if(l > r, l, r);
	 }
    }

    def height() -> int; // top-level method declaration
}
var leaf1 = Tree.Leaf(99);
var leaf2 = Tree.Leaf(98);
var node = Tree.Node(leaf1, leaf2);
var x = node.height();  // == 2
```

## ADTs are immutable and use structural-equivalence ##

In Virgil, ADT values are not (necessarily) represented as objects.
Instead, ADT values are always deep-compared for equality; the case and the parameters must be equivalent.
Thus they have no identity, and the compiler may represent them more efficiently, e.g. by not allocating heap memory when not needed.

```
type Op {
     case Add;
     case Sub;
     case Inc(v: int);
}
var x = (Op.Add == Op.Sub); // false
var y = (Op.Inc(3) == Op.Sub); // false
var z = (Op.Inc(11) == Op.Inc(11)); // true, structurally equal
```

## ADT cases have types ##

In Virgil, the individual case declarations can be used as types, not just the "outer" ADT type.
This allows using them as more specific data structures throughout your program.

```
type Pet {
     case Cat(litterbox: Location);
     case Dog(toy: Toy);
}
def playWith(dog: Pet.Dog) { // accepts only dogs; sorry, no cats!
    toss(dog.toy);
}
```

## ADT tags ##

It's often useful to have a unique integer ID for each case in an ADT.
Virgil automatically provides the `tag` field (an integer) that is a constant corresponding to a case's declaration order, starting from `0`.
For example, a common use is as an index into an `Array` holding constant data, an efficient lookup that doesn't pollute the ADT definition with information specific to a particular use case.
ADTs also have the `name` field that is the `string` name of the case, which is very commonly useful.

```
type Instrument {
    case Pen;
    case Pencil;
    case Marker;
    case Quill;
}
def targetMedia = ["paper", "paper", "a whiteboard", "parchment"];
def write(w: Instrument) {
    System.puts("Write to ");
    System.puts(targetMedia[w.tag]); // looks up the appropriate medium
    System.puts(" with a ");
    System.puts(w.name);             // uses the name of the instrument
    System.puts("!\n");
}
```

## Matching ADTs ##

Virgil allows match statements to pattern-match on values of an algebraic datatype.
We use a syntax that mirrors the declaration of the ADT and allows us to bind to the parameters of each case of the ADT.
Match statements on ADTs are checked to be exhaustive: i.e. they must cover every case of the ADT, even if just by defining a default case.

```
type A {
    case B(foo: int);
    case C(bar: int);
}
def do(a: A) -> int {
    match (a) {
        B(foo) => return foo; // match and bind params of a B
        C(bar) => return bar; // match and bind params of a C
    }  // match must be exhaustive
    // unreachable, because all cases return
}
```
